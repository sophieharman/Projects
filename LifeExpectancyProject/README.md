Abstract: Life expectancy is a critical measure of societal well-being, reflecting health outcomes, socio economic development, and quality of life. Our research investigates the question, “What are the most significant factors that influence life expectancy across countries?” We employed linear regression, feature importance analysis, and Principal Component Analysis, to identify key predictors of life expectancy. Our analysis revealed that socioeconomic variables, such as income composition and years of schooling, along with health factors, are strong predictors of life expectancy.
