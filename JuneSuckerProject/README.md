Abstract: Utah Lake has undergone significant changes in fish populations over recent decades, with the June sucker, a critically endangered species, experiencing near-extinction and subsequent restocking efforts. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of the June sucker population under the effects of predation, competition with non-native species, and hybridization. We develop a comprehensive model that integrates elements from single-species logistic growth, predator-prey dynamics, inter-species competition, and the effects of human intervention. Simulations demonstrate how interactions between these factors influence population trends over time and provide insights into the effectiveness of conservation measures. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive management in preserving biodiversity within ecosystems.
