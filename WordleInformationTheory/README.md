This project applies information theory concepts to solve the popular game Wordle efficiently. By evaluating the entropy of each potential guess, the algorithm identifies the guesses most likely to provide the maximum information. Using a predefined list of possible secret words, the strategy systematically narrows down the options, significantly reducing the number of guesses required to identify the secret word. The entropy-based strategy is expected to significantly reduce the number of guesses needed to identify the secret word and consistently outperforms a random guessing strategy.
